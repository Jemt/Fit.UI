# Fit.UI

Fit.UI is an object oriented JavaScript based UI framework.
It consists of two main parts:

In **Core** you'll find everything you need to write Object Oriented apps
in JavaScript. It enhances native JS with added features for:

 - Arrays/collections
 - Browser detection
 - Cookie storage
 - DOM and CSS manipulation
 - Templating for SoC
 - Events and Manipulation Observers
 - Drag and Drop
 - Async. HTTP (AJAX)
 - JSON
 - Async. JS and CSS loader
 - Type checking and validation

On top of Core we've built **Controls** which is a set of very nice UI Controls and components,
exposing rich APIs and event models.

 - Button
 - CheckBox
 - Context Menu
 - Dialog
 - Date and Time Picker with calendar widget
 - Drop Down (with ListView or TreeView)
 - File Picker (async. upload with image previews)
 - Input (with HTML editing using CKEditor)
 - Progress Bar
 - Tree View
 - and more to come

Fit.UI supports all major browsers (FireFox, Chrome, Edge, Opera, Safari, and even Internet Explorer 8+).
A lot of work has been put into making Fit.UI the most compatible framework available, leaving nobody behind.

# Get started

Either get Fit.UI from http://fitui.org or install it using NodeJS Package Manager (https://www.npmjs.com/package/fit-ui).

# Examples

Check out this super cool upload component based on
Button, FilePicker, and ProgressBar:

Here is the Input control with support for HTML editing
thanks to the power of CKEditor:

Buttons are essential to almost all applications, and FIT.UI
provides some great onces, with support for FontAwesome icons:

Navigation and data selection is equally important to websites
and applications, so we provide a great TreeView and DropDown control
for that. Also notice that all controls have a WebService enabled
sibling that automatically loads data from a server in JSON format:
