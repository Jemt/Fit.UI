# Fit.UI

Fit.UI is an object oriented JavaScript based UI framework.
It consists of two main parts:

In **Core** you'll find everything you need to write Object Oriented apps
in JavaScript. It enhances native JS with added features for:

 - Arrays/collections
 - Browser detection
 - Cookie, Local, and Session Storage
 - DOM and CSS manipulation
 - Events and Manipulation Observers
 - Drag and Drop
 - Async. HTTP (AJAX)
 - JSON
 - Async. JS and CSS loader
 - Type checking and validation

On top of Core we've built **Controls** which is a set of very nice UI Controls and components.

 - Button
 - Tree View
 - Drop Down (with ListView or TreeView)
 - Context Menu
 - Progress Bar
 - File Picker (async. upload with image previews)
 - Input (with HTML editing using CKEditor)
 - and more to come

We have been working very hard on Fit.UI since March 2015 and is expecting
to ship a pre-compiled and ready-to-use package around summer 2016.

# Example
