  "description": "This plugin implements draggable image resizing, currently just for Webkit-based browsers (Chrome/Safari/Opera). This feature already exists in Firefox and Internet Explorer as a built-in browser capability but not in the other browsers. So if you or your users are used to seeing the drag-to-resize handles at the corner of images, but use Chrome or Safari, install this plugin to get it back (with a few bonus features).",
