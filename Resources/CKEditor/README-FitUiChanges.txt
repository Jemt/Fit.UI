CKEditor has been built using the web builder - configuration found in build-config.js

The build has been supplemented with the following plugins:
 - base64image (heavily modified)
 - base64imagepaste (custom plugin created for Fit.UI)
 - custombuttons (custom plugin created for Fit.UI used for e.g. detach button (dialog editor))
 - dragresize (minor fix(es))

Take care not to replace these plugins with old and buggy versions if upgrading CKEditor at some point !
